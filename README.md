## Overview
In this work, We present Unified Embeddings for Multimodal Retrieval (UNIMUR), a simple but effective approach that embeds multimodal inputs and retrieves visual and textual outputs via frozen Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, UNIMUR jointly retrieves multimodal outputs via a unified multimodal embedding and applies dual alignment training to account for both visual and textual semantics. Thus, unlike previous approaches, UNIMUR significantly reduces LLMâ€™s modality bias towards generating text-only outputs. Meanwhile, the proposed unified multimodal embedding mitigates the inconsistency between visual and textual outputs and provides coherent multimodal outputs. Furthermore, benefiting from the joint training of visual and textual semantics, UNIMUR also achieves strong image/text retrieval ability.


## Setup 

### Install Dependencies

1. (Optional) Set up a new conda environment, and install the required libraries:
```
conda create -n unimur python=3.8
conda activate unimur
```

2. Install the required libraries
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


3. Add the `unimur` library to PYTHONPATH:
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/path/to/unimur/
```

### Pretrained Checkpoints

The pruned UNIMUR model weights (linear layers and [RET] embedding) are small and are included in this Git repo. They will be in the `unimur_model/` folder after cloning. The checkpoint and model config in `unimur_model/` reproduce the results reported in our paper.


### Precomputed Embeddings For Image Retrieval

We follow FROMAGe [URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13823) which leverages the visual embedding of CC3M images for retrieval. Please follow their instructions, download the files, and place `cc3m_embeddings.pkl` into the `unimur_model/` directory.


## Inference

Check out `FROMAGe_example_notebook.ipynb` for examples on calling the model for inference. Several of the figures presented in the paper are reproduced in this notebook using greedy decoding of the model. Note that there may be minor differences in image outputs due to CC3M images being lost over time.


## Training

### Preparing CC3M

Our model is trained on the [Conceptual Captions](https://ai.google.com/research/ConceptualCaptions) dataset. After following the instructions on the website to download the captions and images, format it into a `.tsv` file as follows:

```
caption image
A picture of a cat  cat.png
Mountains  mountain.png
```
where each line contains the caption followed by the filename of the image files. Save these `.tsv` files into the `dataset/` folder (the default names expected are `cc3m_train.tsv` and `cc3m_val.tsv`). The repo contains two placeholder files, and you will have to replace them with the appropriate data.

The corresponding image files should be saved in the `data/` directory. The directory can be changed with the `--image-dir` runtime flag.


### Training FROMAGe

After preparing CC3M as detailed above, you can start a new training job with the following command line flag:

```
randport=$(shuf -i8000-9999 -n1)  # Generate a random port number
python -u main.py \
    --dist-url "tcp://127.0.0.1:${randport}" --dist-backend 'nccl' \
    --multiprocessing-distributed --world-size 1 --rank 0 \
    --dataset=cc3m  --val-dataset=cc3m \
    --opt-version='facebook/opt-6.7b' --visual-model='openai/clip-vit-large-patch14' \
    --exp_name='fromage_exp' --image-dir='data/'  --log-base-dir='runs/' \
    --batch-size=180  --val-batch-size=100  --learning-rate=0.0003 --precision='bf16'  --print-freq=100
```

On a single A6000 GPU, the model converges within 24 hours (with a batch size of 180). For GPUs with smaller memory available, you might need to reduce the batch size, enable gradient accumulation, or adjust hyperparameters to get good performance. You may also have to disable NCCL P2P with `export NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1` if you run into issues.


### Pruning Model Weights

As FROMAGe only consists of a few pretrained linear layers and the `[RET]` embedding, we can discard most of the pretrained weights to save on disk space. If you have trained a new model, and wish to do so, you can use `fromage/prune_model_ckpt.py` to prune the model weights. We used the same script to create the weights in the `fromage_model` directory.


### Unit Tests

You can also test that the code runs locally by running the unit test with `pytest -x`. This runs a short training and evaluation job, with smaller models, to ensure the code works. The test should complete within approximately 90s.

Note that because of exception catching (to ensure data errors don't terminate training), the test will silently fail and not terminate if there is an I/O error when reading data. Hence, we recommend running the Python command above for debugging data preprocessing.


## Evaluation

We provide an evaluation script to reproduce our results on contextual image retrieval on Visual Storytelling (results of Table 1 of our paper). The script can be run from `evals/eval_vist_retrieval.py`. There is also a iPython notebook version (`VIST_Contextual_Image_Retrieval.ipynb`) in the same directory.

Similarly, we provide scripts to reproduce the text generation and image retrieval results on VisDial (presented in Table 2 of our paper). The script for VisDial text generation can be run from `evals/eval_visdial_generation.py` (or through the notebook version, `VisDial_Inference_IT2T_Generation.ipynb`). This reports the NDCG, MRR, and R@k scores for VisDial.

The results for image retrieval can be reproduced by running the `evals/eval_visdial_retrieval.py` script (or through the notebook version `VisDial_Inference_T2I_Retrieval.ipynb`), which reports R@k scores.


## Gradio Demo

You can launch your own version of the Gradio demo locally by running `python demo/app.py`, or duplicating the [HuggingFace space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jykoh/fromage).
